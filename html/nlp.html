<h3>Natural language processing with a multi-layer perseptron</h3>
<p>
This is the neural network for sentiment analysis described in Andrew Trask's excellent book "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grokking-Deep-Learning-Andrew-Trask/dp/1617293709/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=deep+learning&qid=1568656440&sr=8-5">Grokking Deep Learning</a>". The aim is for the network to use the text and the star rating of a collection of film reviews downloaded from the udacity deep-learning mooc. The data can be retrieved using the following commands. </p>
